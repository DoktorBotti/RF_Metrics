Folder ALN contains alignments that were used to compute the
respective bootstrap trees. If a .par-file is present, use this file
for a partitioned analysis (-q in RAxML).

Folder BS contains 10,000 bootstrap trees. In order to reproduce
results from the paper, reduce this set to the first 1,000 trees.

Data sets mentioned in the paper, but not present here, contain
unpublished data.
