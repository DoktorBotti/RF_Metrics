RAxML computation of RF distances for all pairs of trees in a set of trees


RAxML was called as follows:

./raxmlHPC -m GTRCAT -f r -z ../data/heads/BS/1288 -w home/luise/Exelixis-Lab/standard-RAxML/1288 -n 0 




Found 10 trees in File ../data/heads/BS/1288



Average relative RF in this set: 0.412330


Number of unique trees in this tree set: 10

File containing all 45 pair-wise RF distances written to file /home/luise/Exelixis-Lab/standard-RAxML/1288/RAxML_RF-Distances.0
