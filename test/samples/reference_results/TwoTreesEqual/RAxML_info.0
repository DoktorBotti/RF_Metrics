RAxML computation of RF distances for all pairs of trees in a set of trees


RAxML was called as follows:

standard-RAxML/./raxmlHPC-AVX -m GTRCAT -f r -z ../Bioinformatics/practical-2021/test/res/data/heads/BS/TwoTreesEqual -n Equalsmall 




Found 2 trees in File ../Bioinformatics/practical-2021/test/res/data/heads/BS/TwoTreesEqual



Average relative RF in this set: 0.000000


Number of unique trees in this tree set: 1

File containing all 1 pair-wise RF distances written to file /home/paincrash/Desktop/Raxml/RAxML_RF-Distances.Equalsmall
